sdesc: "Search indexed text regions like SGML,XML and HTML files"
ldesc: "Structured grep is a tool for searching and indexing text, SGML,XML
and HTML files and filtering text streams using structural criteria.
The data model of sgrep is based on regions, which are nonempty
substrings of text. Regions are typically occurrences of constant
strings, SGML-tags, or meaningful text elements, which are
recognizable through some delimiting strings or the builtin SGML, XML
and HTML parser. Regions can be arbitrarily long, arbitrarily
overlapping, and arbitrarily nested."
